# SuvivalPlus

SurvivalPlus is a Java plugin to improve the vanilla

In reality, i made this plugin to learn Java with the Spigot API. I would like to be a better devlopper to make huge things later.

## Improvements

Temperature System:
 
- HOT Biomes:
    - When you are in hot biomes, you will take 0.25 damages every 5 secondes
    - (WIP) You will be dehydrated and need to drink water
- COLD Biomes:
    - When you are in cold biomes, you will be slowed
    - An effect of frozen is applied to the player for immersive gameplay
-  Armors
    - If you wear at least 2 pieces of **GOLDEN** armor, you were protected from the heat
    - If you wear at least 2 pieces of **LEATHER** armor, you were protected from the cold


(WIP):
- Fatigue system
- New monsters
- New items
